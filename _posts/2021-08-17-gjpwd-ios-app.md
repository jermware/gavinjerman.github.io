[**gjPwd**](/gjPwd) is an iOS app for generating secure, easy to use, passwords.

This is my second iOS app and is written in [Swift](https://swift.org), including user interface (no more [Storyboards](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/interface-builder/), apart from the [Launch Screen](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/launch-screen/)). The UI is built using [LBTATools](https://github.com/bhlvoong/LBTATools) v1.0.12.

**Bart Busschots**' [xkpasswd](https://xkpasswd.net) is a wonderful website for creating secure memorable passwords. Secure passwords generators are ubiquitous and a must have feature of any [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager). _If you're not using a password manager, you really should consider using one._ The problem with a lot of generated passwords e.g. **F7M6!uH_bN9QUtbd**, is they are difficult to use if you ever have to type them in manually, rather than auto-filling from a password manager. Bart took inspiration from an [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/936/) web comic to write a password generator that creates passwords that are both secure, and memorable i.e. easier to enter manually.

Inspired by **xkpasswd**, in April 2019 I decided to create an app that would generate secure, memorable, passwords. Rather than use Bart's open source [XKPasswd.pm](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/publications/software/xkpasswd/) password generation library, I decided to implement my own Swift password generator that used Bart's approach to generating passwords i.e. use a specified number of words, of specified lengths, from a dictionary, and applying the required transformation, separators, and padding.

By November 2019 I had a working app that, although not as feature rich as [xkpasswd](https://xkpasswd.net), provides all the functionality I need.

The complexity of the passwords generated by the app can be configured by specifying the number and length of words, separators and padding etc., or by selecting a pre-set password configuration e.g. Apple ID or security question.

Generated passwords are automatically copied to the clipboard of the iOS device and, if [Universal Clipboard](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl70368996/mac) is configured correctly, will be copied to the Mac's clipboard. This is useful for generating a password on an iPhone and pasting it into a website on a Mac.

I use **gjPwd** to generate all my passwords. I find it very useful, but I'm not sure I'll ever release it to the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/uk/app-store/). Maybe if I rewrite it using [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/). We'll see.

First code cut April 2019, code 'complete' November 2019. Various tweaks since but unlikely to be anymore unless future iOS versions break the app.
