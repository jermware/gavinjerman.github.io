[**gjLists**](/gjLists) has been updated to **v2023.1** on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/gjlists/id1528217135?platform=iphone).


This is a maintenance release with the following changes:
- Fixed a bug that could cause the app to exit unexpectedly when loading lists from iCloud.
- Replaced the deprecated CountAPI with [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com/) for the collection of anonymous usage data for private analytics to help understand how the app is used and to support future developments.
