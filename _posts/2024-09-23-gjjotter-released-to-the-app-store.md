[**gjJotter**](/gjJotter) is my ninth app released on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/gjjotter/id6698850903?platform=iphone).

I often need to capture something quickly with minimal fuss and effort. Previously, I was using a favourited note in [**gjNotes**](/gjNotes) as a scratch pad for this, which I accessed through the widget on my Home Screen. This worked well but felt like overkill for such a simple task.

This is where **gjJotter** comes in. It’s a simple, no-frills jotter pad for your jottings, notes, to-do lists, etc. There’s no need to create a new note and save it when you’re done. There’s only ever one jotter pad, it automatically saves itself, and is always available. Add the widget to your Home Screen, and your jotter/scratch pad is just a tap away.

If you want, you can adjust the font size to suit your preference. You can also choose between a light or dark theme. That’s it. No bells and whistles. Just a simple place to capture your jottings quickly and easily.

Why not give **gjJotter** a try? It’s free, and there are no ads. You can download it from the App Store using the link below. If you find it useful, please consider leaving a review on the App Store—thanks!
