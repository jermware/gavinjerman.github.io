[**gjICE**](/projects/gjICE) has been updated to **v2023.1** on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/gjice/id6443990092?platform=iphone).

This is a maintenance release with the following changes:

- Replaced the deprecated CountAPI with [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com/) for the collection of anonymous usage data for private analytics to help understand how the app is used and to support future developments.
