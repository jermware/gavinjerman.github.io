# gjNotes Updated on the App Store

[**gjNotes**](/projects/gjNotes) has been updated to **v2023.1** on the on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/gjnotes/id1562333522?platform=iphone).  

This is a maintenance release with the following changes:
- Fixed a bug that could cause the app to ignore blanks lines when pasting notes from the clipboard. Apologies if you were affected by this.
- Replaced the deprecated CountAPI with [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com/) for the collection of anonymous usage data for private analytics to help understand how the app is used and to support future developments.
