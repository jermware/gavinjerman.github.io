&nbsp;&nbsp;An iOS Lock Screen widget for emergency contact details.

Use **gjICE** to display your _In Case of Emergency_ (ICE) contact details in a widget on the Lock Screen.

iOS 16.0 introduced 3 new [Lock Screen widget](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph4d0e6c351/ios#iph0ee454f4c) types for iPhones:
- an inline rectangular widget displayed above the date and alongside the time
- small circular widgets displayed below the date
- rectangular widgets displayed below the data

One inline, and up to 4 circular or 2 rectangular widgets may be displayed on the Lock Screen.

<br><br>

**gjICE** is a rectangular widget that displays up to 3 lines of text below the Lock Screen date.

<br><br>

The text font size is automatically reduced to accommodate long lines, although very long lines will be truncated. Empty lines are ignored.

<br><br>

Text may be formatted using basic [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet):
  - to **bold** text, add two asterisks (`**`) or underscores (`__`) before and after a word or phrase.

<br><br>

  - to *italicise* text, add one asterisk (`*`) or underscore (`_`) before and after a word or phrase.

  - to ~~strikethrough~~ text, add two tildes (`~~`) before and after a word or phrase.

Emojis may be used, but they will appear washed out since iOS applies a tint to all Lock Screen widgets.
