&nbsp;&nbsp;An iOS app for creating notes.
<br>

Use **gjNotes** to create plain text notes using a clean, simple, and intuitive interface.

Creating notes is easy. Just start typing in the _New note_ field and tap _Done_ to save your note.

Swipe left on a note to delete it:

Swipe right on a note to favourite or un-favourite it:

<br><br>

You may only have one favourite note. Your favourite note is the note displayed in the widget on your device's home screen. Three sizes of widget are supported: small, medium, and large.

Rearrange notes either by tapping, holding, and dragging them, or by tapping _Edit_ and moving them using the **≡** symbol. Tap _Done_ when finished. Notes may be deleted in _Edit_ mode by tapping the red **⊖** symbol.

<br><br>

Notes can also be created by pasting them from the device's clipboard using the _Paste from clipboard_ option off the ellipsis (…) menu on the _gjNotes_ screen. This allows notes to be created in other apps e.g., text editors, either on or off the device, pasted to the device's clipboard e.g. via _Universal Clipboard_ and pasted into **gjNotes**.

Notes can be copied to the device's clipboard, using the _Copy to clipboard_ option off the ellipsis (…) menu on the _gjNotes_ screen, allowing them to be pasted into other apps.

The following housekeeping options are available to manage your notes:
- ***Delete all notes*** (accessible from the ellipsis (…) menu on the _gjNotes_ screen). All notes are deleted from the device and iCloud. You will have no notes after confirming this option. ***Use with caution***.
- ***Backup notes*** (accessible from the _Settings -> Maintenance_ screen) - all notes are saved to the selected location in iCloud, a device folder, a shared location etc. Use this to regularly back up your notes. You never know when you will need it.
- ***Restore notes*** (accessible from the _Settings -> Maintenance_ screen) - all existing notes are deleted and replaced with the notes contained in the backup file in the selected location in iCloud, a device folder, a shared location etc. Use this to restore notes from a previous back up. Your existing notes will be replaced after using this option. ***Use with caution***.
