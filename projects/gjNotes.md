Use **gjNotes** to create plain text notes using a clean, simple, and intuitive interface.

Creating notes is easy. Just start typing in the _New note_ field and tap _Done_ to save your note.

Swipe left on a note to delete it:
<br>![delete note](/images/gjNotes/0-delete.png){:width="300px"}

Swipe right on a note to favourite or un-favourite it:
<br>![favourite note](/images/gjNotes/0-favourite.png){:width="300px"} &nbsp; ![un-favourite note](/images/gjNotes/0-unfavourite.png){:width="300px"}

You may only have one favourite note. Your favourite note is the note displayed in the widget on your home screen. Three sizes of widget are supported: small, medium, and large.

![small widget](/images/gjNotes/0-widget-small.png){:width="300px"}
![medium widget](/images/gjNotes/0-widget-medium.png){:width="300px"}
![large widget](/images/gjNotes/0-widget-large.png){:width="300px"}

Rearrange notes either by tapping, holding, and dragging them, or by tapping _Edit_ and moving them using the **≡** symbol. Tap _Done_ when finished moving notes. Notes may also be deleted when in _Edit_ mode by tapping the red **⊖** symbol.

Notes can also be created by pasting them from the device's clipboard using the _Paste from clipboard_ option off the ellipsis (…) menu on the **gjNotes** screen. This allows notes to be created in other apps e.g., text editors, either on or off the device, pasted to the device's clipboard e.g. via _Universal Clipboard_ and pasted into **gjNotes**.

Notes can be copied to the device's clipboard, using the _Copy to clipboard_ option off the ellipsis (…) menu on the notes screen, allowing them to be pasted into other apps.

The following housekeeping options to manage notes are available:
- ***Delete all notes*** (accessible from the ellipsis (…) menu on the notes screen) - all notes are deleted from the device and iCloud. You will have no notes after confirming this option. ***Use with caution***.
- ***Backup notes*** (accessible from the _Settings -> Maintenance_ screen) - all notes are saved to the selected location in iCloud, a device folder, a shared location etc. Use this to regularly back up your notes. You never know when you will need it.
- ***Restore notes*** (accessible from the _Settings -> Maintenance_ screen) - all existing notes are deleted and replaced with the notes contained in the backup file in the selected location in iCloud, a device folder, a shared location etc. Use this to restore notes from a previous back up. Your existing notes will be replaced after using this option. ***Use with caution***.

- Requires iOS 16.1 or later.
- Designed for iPhone and iPad.

- iCloud note synchronisation across devices.

- Anonymous usage statistics from [CountAPI](https://countapi.xyz).

<h3 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h3>

The policy applies to all information collected on **gjNotes'** website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

**TL;DR**  
**Your data is your data**.  
**We don’t want to have any of your data.**  
**We don't use trackers**.  
**We can't read your notes**.  

**Information**  
No personal information, location data, or app usage metrics are collected.

We collect anonymous usage data for private analytics to help understand how the app is used and to support future developments. This is done by incrementing a number whenever you use certain features, but we only do a +1 on aggregated global counters so we have no idea who sent the event.

The usage data are not used for marketing, tracking, advertisement or anything alike.

**iCloud**  
All data syncing is done through Apple’s iCloud service. The only data stored in iCloud are your notes. These data are only accessible by you when using the app on a device logged into your iCloud account.

**Local Storage**  
Your notes are always saved locally on your device. This allows you to access your notes even if iCloud access is not available. Your notes will remain on your device until you delete them within the app, or you delete the app from your device.

**Diagnostics**  
If you turn on _Diagnostics_ in the app's _Settings_ screen (the default setting is off), a log file containing debugging information is written to your device. The log file is written to until you turn off _Diagnostics_ and remains on your device until you delete it. The contents of the log file are never transmitted by the app and remain on your device unless you explicitly share them with someone else. No personal information is saved in the log file.

**Your Consent**  
By using our website or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

**Contact Us**  
If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email [jermware@mac.com](mailto:jermware@mac.com).

**Changes to this Policy**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Summary of changes so far:
