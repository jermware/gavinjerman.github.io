<h3 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h3>

The policy applies to all information collected on **gjNotes'** website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

**TL;DR**  
**Your data is your data**.  
**We don’t want to have any of your data.**  
**We don't use trackers**.  
**We can't read your notes**.  

**Information**  
No personal information, location data, or app usage metrics are collected.

We collect anonymous usage data for private analytics to help understand how the app is used and to support future developments. This is done by incrementing a number whenever you use certain features, but we only do a +1 on aggregated global counters so we have no idea who sent the event.

The usage data are not used for marketing, tracking, advertisement or anything alike.

**iCloud**  
All data syncing is done through Apple’s iCloud service. The only data stored in iCloud are your notes. These data are only accessible by you when using the app on a device logged into your iCloud account.

**Local Storage**  
Your notes are always saved locally on your device. This allows you to access your notes even if iCloud access is not available. Your notes will remain on your device until you delete them within the app, or you delete the app from your device.

**Diagnostics**  
If you turn on _Diagnostics_ in the app's _Settings_ screen (the default setting is off), a log file containing debugging information is written to your device. The log file is written to until you turn off _Diagnostics_, and remains on your device until you delete it. The contents of the log file are never transmitted by the app and remain on your device unless you explicitly share them with someone else. No personal information is saved in the log file.

**Your Consent**  
By using our website or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

**Contact Us**  
If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email [jermware@mac.com](mailto:jermware@mac.com).

**Changes to this Policy**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Summary of changes so far:
