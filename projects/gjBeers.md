Drinking a new beer? Take a photo of the pump clip, or the beer, with the iOS device. In the app add a new beer, choosing the appropriate photo. The app uses the photo's [EXIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) data to give the date, time, and location, and allows you to enter the name, brewery, rating, and tasting notes for the beer.

The collection is searchable by beer name and sortable by name, date, brewery, and rating. It is viewable as an image gallery, as a list of beer names, as a list of brewery names, or as a ratings list. From these lists it is possible to view the beer’s details.

**Feature:**
- Requires iOS 15.0 or later.
- Designed for iPhone and iPad.
- Only a reference to the image in the device’s photo library is stored, not a copy of the image. This eliminates the significant storage overhead of duplicating the photos.
- Various reports can be viewed and copied to the clipboard for exporting to other apps or devices.
- Backup and restore your beers.
- Supports system dark and light modes.
