Use **gjBeers** to keep track of, and rate, your beers.

Drinking a new beer? Take a photo of the pump clip, or the beer, with your iOS device and in the app add a new beer and select the appropriate image from your photos library. The app uses the photo’s [EXIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) data to show the location, and allows you to enter the name, brewery, style, rating, and tasting notes for the beer.

You can add multiple images to a beer so, as well as the pump clip for example, you can also save an image of the actual poured pint of beer, or you can add additional images of the pump clip as it changes through time.  
![multiple images](/images/gjBeers/0-multiple-images.png){:width="256px"}

The collection is searchable by beer or brewery name and sortable by name, brewery, rating, style and date, making it easy to browse your collection or look for a specific beer or brewery.  
![search text](/images/gjBeers/1-search-text.png){:width="256px"}
![sort options](/images/gjBeers/2-sort-options.png){:width="256px"}

Your beer images are stored alongside their data in the app's database, so they do not have to remain in your device's photos library. A user setting allows you to specify the compression quality of the images to give you control over the storage space used on your device.

iCloud is used to synchronise your collection on all your devices. For additional security your beers, including images if required, can be backed up to, and restored from, an external file.

**Features:**
- Requires iOS 17.5 or later.
- Designed for iPhone and iPad.
- Searchable and sortable.
- Zero to 5 star rating in half-star increments.
- Choosable image compression quality.
- Backup and restore your beers.
- iCloud synchronisation of beers across devices.
- Supports system dark and light modes.
