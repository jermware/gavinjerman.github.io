**gjPwd** is my second iOS app. It is written in [Swift](https://swift.org), including user interface (no more [Storyboards](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/interface-builder/), apart from the [Launch Screen](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/launch-screen/)).

**Bart Busschots**' [xkpasswd](https://xkpasswd.net) is a wonderful website for creating secure memorable passwords. Secure passwords generators are ubiquitous and a must have feature of any [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager). _If you're not using a password manager, you really should consider using one._ The problem with a lot of generated passwords e.g., **F7M6!uH_bN9QUtbd**, is they are difficult to use if you ever have to type them in manually, rather than auto-filling from a password manager. Bart took inspiration from an [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/936/) web comic to write a password generator that creates passwords that are both secure, and memorable i.e. easier to enter manually.

Inspired by **xkpasswd**, in April 2019 I decided to create an app that would generate secure, memorable, passwords. Rather than use Bart's open source [XKPasswd.pm](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/publications/software/xkpasswd/) password generation library, I decided to implement my own Swift password generator that used Bart's approach to generating passwords i.e. use a specified number of words, of specified lengths, from a dictionary, and applying the required transformation, separators, and padding.

By November 2019 I had a working app that, although not as feature rich as [xkpasswd](https://xkpasswd.net), provides all the functionality I need.

The passwords generated by the app can be configured by specifying:
- number of words: 2 to 9
- minimum and maximum word length: 4 to 11
- word case transformation type:
    - none
    - lower case
    - UPPER CASE
    - alternating WORD case
    - EVERY word randomly CAPITALISED or NOT
    - Capitalise First Letter
    - cAPITALISE eVERY lETTER eXCEPT tHE fIRST
- separator between words:
    - none
    - random
    - !@$%^&*-_+=:\|~?/.;
- number of digits before and after the words: 0 to 5
- padding:
    - random
    - !@$%^&*-_+=:\|~?/.;
- amount padding at the beginning and end of the password: 0 to 5
- number of passwords to generate: 1 to 19

Alternatively, the app includes a number of preset password configurations:
- Default (PPDDSWSWSWSDDPP)
- gjGood (WSWSDD)
- gjVeryGood (WSWSWSDD)
- gjStrong (WSWSWSWSDD)
- gjVeryStrong (DDSWSWSWSWSDD)
- gjStrongest (PPPDDDSWSWSWSWSWSWSDDDPPP)
- AppleID (PDDSWSWSWSDDP)
- NTLM (DSWSWP)
- SecurityQ (WSWSWSWSWSWP)
- Web16 (PWSWSWP)
- Web32 (PDDSWSWSWSWSDDP)
- WiFi (PPPPDDDDSWSWSWSWSWSWSDDDDPPPP)
- XKCD (WSWSWSW)
- XKPasswd (PPDDSWSWSWSDDPP)

    where P: padding, D: digit, S: separator, W: word

When passwords are generated they are copied to the clipboard of the iOS device and, if [Universal Clipboard](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl70368996/mac) is configured correctly, will be copied to the Mac's clipboard. This is really useful for generating a password on an iPhone and pasting it into a website on a Mac.

I use **gjPwd** to generate all of my passwords. I find it really useful, but I'm not sure I'll ever release it to the App Store. Maybe if I rewrite it using [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/). We'll see.

Notes:

- Written in Swift with UI built using [LBTATools](https://github.com/bhlvoong/LBTATools) v1.0.12.
- Insprired by **[xkpasswd](https://xkpasswd.net)** from **[Bart Busschots](https://www.bartbusschots.ie)**.
- First code cut April 2019, code 'complete' November 2019. Numerous tweaks since but unlikely to be anymore unless future iOS versions break the app.
- Supports system dark and light modes.
- Password automatically copied to _Universal Clipboard_.
- Custom stepper based on [GMStepper](https://github.com/gmertk/GMStepper).
- Key icon from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/4326/house-key).
