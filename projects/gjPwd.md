Inspired by **Bart Busschots**' [xkpasswd](https://xkpasswd.net) website, **[gjPwd](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/gjpwd/id1532589670#?platform=iphone)** creates passwords that are both secure, and memorable i.e. easier to enter manually.

Passwords generated by the app can be configured by specifying:
- number of words: 2 to 9
- minimum and maximum word length: 4 to 11
- word case transformation type:
    - none
    - lower case
    - UPPER CASE
    - alternating WORD case
    - EVERY word randomly CAPITALISED or NOT
    - Capitalise First Letter
    - cAPITALISE eVERY lETTER eXCEPT tHE fIRST
- separator between words:
    - none
    - random
    - various characters e.g. `⎵!@$%^&*-_+=:\|~?/.;`
- number of digits before and after words: 0 to 5
- padding:
    - random
    - various characters e.g. `!@$%^&*-_+=:\|~?/.;`
- amount padding at the beginning and end of the password: 0 to 5
- number of passwords to generate: 1 to 19

Alternatively, the app includes several pre-set password configurations:
- **XKCD** `WSWSWSW` e.g. _friend-CORRECT-SLOWLY-timeline_
- **gjGood** `WSWSDD` e.g. _tore.TRAIN.58_
- **gjVeryGood** `WSWSWSDD` e.g. _america.DECIMAL.serve.90_
- **gjStrong** `WSWSWSWSDD` e.g. _current.TUESDAY.kentucky.ETCHING.38_
- **gjVeryStrong** `DDSWSWSWSWSDD` e.g. _65.father.BROUGHT.scene.LESBIANS.54_
- **gjStrongest** `PPPDDDSWSWSWSWSWSWSDDDPPP` e.g. _...390.CLIMBED.computer.FOOL.someone.GROWN.care.760..._
- **AppleID** `PDDSWSWSWSDDP` e.g. _@51;SEVERAL;PREPARE;AMOUNT;55@_
- **SecurityQ** `WSWSWSWSWSWP` e.g. _east sudden live distance market branch!_
- **WiFi** `PPPPDDDDSWSWSWSWSWSWSDDDDPPPP` e.g. _::::7640*science*PROMISE*please*ANIMAL*HOLD*GREAT*6288::::_
- **XKPasswd** `PPDDSWSWSWSDDPP` e.g. _^^68=bottle=BORROW=mark=05^^_

    where `D` : digit, `P` : padding, `S` : separator, `W` : word
